-1534197113="Remote server or file not found"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has requested a file from the

; clicking a link, and the server cannot send the requested document in a
; format that matches the content of the HTTP accept headers sent in the
; request (HTTP error code 406), if the user has set the Network/Server
; errors/Always show dialog box preference. However, Opera accepts all
; document formats and sends *.* in its accept header, so this is unlikely
; to happen.
1149298043="The server was unable to send acceptable data"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has requested a document from
; the server, the server needs more data from Opera to fulfill the

; or send a document to the server, and the server determins that there's
; a conflict with a third part regarding the document, that can be solved
; by the user (HTTP error message 409). This could happen when the user
; submits a form that leads to a change of an online document, and the
; server detects that the changes conflicts with other changes already
; made to the document. Visible if the user has set the Network/Server
; errors/Always show dialog box preference
1517647577="Conflict with existing resource on server"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has requested a document and

; the Network/Server errors/Always show dialog box preference.
-711230064="The address is no longer available"

; Used in a popup error message if the user has sent a request to the
; server, and the server answers that it needs a Content-Length header to
; process the request (HTTP error code 411). Opera never sends requests
; without a valid Content-Lenght header. Visible if the user has set the
; Network/Server errors/Always show dialog box preference.
758757449="HTTP content length was required"

; Used in a popup error message if the user has sent a request to the server
; containing one or more precondition headers, and one or more of these
; preconditions evaluated false on the server (HTTP error code 412). The
; precondition headers could be If-Range and If-Modifified-Since, that
; could be used to fetch the missing parts of a earlier partially fetched
; documents, if the document is still the same. Unlikely to happen.
; Visible if the user has set the Network/Server errors/Always show dialog
; box preference.
329914774="HTTP preconditions failed"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has sent a request to a

-1058835823="HTTP request data was too long"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has sent a request to a server
; and the URL is longer than the server can handle (HTTP error code 414).
; Visible if the user has set the Network/Server errors/Always show dialog
; box preference.
-1079658918="The HTTP address is too long"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has sent a request to a server
; and the server didn't recognize the content type of the request entitiy
; (HTTP error code 415). Visible if the user has set the Network/Server
; errors/Always show dialog box preference.
-1140372240="The server did not recognize the content type"

; Used in a popup error message if Opera has requested a part of a file that
; does not exist (HTTP error code 416). This shouldn't happen. Visible if
; the user has set the Network/Server errors/Always show dialog box
; preference.
-616120726="The server could not send the requested part of the file"

; Used in a popup error message if Opera has sent a request with certain
; expectations in the HTTP header 'Expect', and the server can't meet that
; expectation because vital features are not implemented. For example, the
; server can be expected to handle HTTP_CONTINUE (HTTP reply code 100)
; when sending in forms (HTTP error code 417). Visible if the user has set
; the Network/Server errors/Always show dialog box preference.
857450575="HTTP expectation failed"

; Used in a popup error message when Opera has sent a request to a HTTP
; proxy server, and the upstream server returned an invalid response code

; the server can't fulfill the request since it's overloaded or offline
; (HTTP error code 503). Visible if the user has set the Network/Server
; errors/Always show dialog box preference.
1578430811="The service is overloaded or offline. Please try again later"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has sent a request to a proxy
; server, and the upstream server did not answer before the proxy server
; timed out (HTTP error code 504). Visible if the user has set the
; Network/Server errors/Always show dialog box preference.
-1311914337="HTTP gateway timed out"

; Used in a popup error message when the user has requested a document from
; a server, and the server doesn't support the HTTP version used (HTTP
; error code 505). Visible if the user has set the Network/Server
; errors/Always show dialog box preference.
1531026242="The HTTP version was not accepted"

; Used in a warning popup message when the user has tried to fetch a
; document from a server, using HTTP digest authentication to check the
; documents integrity, and the authentication failed.

; Can be used when the the user has entered an FTP URL without user name and
; password into the URL field to do an anonymous login, and the server did
; not accept anonymous logins. Normally an authentication dialog is shown
; instead.
