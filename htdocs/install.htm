<ul>
  <li>The following Windows platforms are supported: 
    <ul>
      <li> Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows 2000 Professional or Windows 2000 Server (SP4 or higher and security updates are recommended)</li>
      <li> Microsoft Windows XP Professional (SP2)</li>      
	  <li> Microsoft Windows Vista<sup><font size="-6">TM</font></sup></li>
      <li> Microsoft Windows Server 2003 (SP1)</li>
      <li> The latest service packs and security updates are recommended for all platforms</li>
      <li> Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 or later 
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Installing the English version of the product updates Internet 
          Explorer with the English version of Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1. If you 
          are running a localized operating system, run Windows Update to ensure 
          that you get the proper localized version of Internet Explorer.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The product requires a number of prerequisites including the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SDK, 
  Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Redistributable Package, Microsoft Visual J#Version 2.0 Redistributable Package,
  Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.8, and Microsoft Core XML Services (MSXML) 6.0.  
  The prerequisites are automatically installed on your system during the install process if 
  they are not already present.  Although .NET 2.0 files are installed and required for the IDE to run, 
  the product does not support development for .NET.</li>

  <li> Free space requirement: Approximately 1.5 GB of disk space is required for full product 
  installation, and the installer requires 2 GB additional temporary space.</li>
  <li> Intel Pentium III/M 1.4GHz or Pentium IV 1.4 GHz minimum (Pentium III/M 1.4 GHz+ or Pentium IV 2GHz+ recommended).</li>

  </ul>
<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<H2 id="General">General Installation Notes</H2>

<h3>Contents</h3>
<p>The RAD Studio installation DVD contains C++Builder 2007 as well as Update 1 of 
Delphi 2007 for Win32. You can use the installation DVD to:
<ul>
<li>Install either product (Delphi 2007 for Win32, Update 1; or C++Builder 2007)</li>
<li>Install both products (Delphi 2007 for Win32, Update 1; and C++Builder 2007)</li>
<li>Upgrade an installation of Delphi 2007 for Win32 to Update 1.
</li></ul>

Note that you can use the installation DVD for Delphi 2007 for Win32 only to install or 
upgrade Delphi 2007, but not to install C++Builder 2007.</p>  

<H3>On Windows Vista<sup><font size="-20">TM</font></sup>, must install as Administrator </H3>
<p>For Windows Vista, you <em>must</em> run as Administrator or be on the Administrator list to 
install the product. 
</p>
<H3>New installer, no bootstrap utility</H3>
Previous versions of Borland Developer Studio and Delphi included a bootstrap utility that checked 
for the presence of prerequisite software and installed it as necessary before the main product install started.  
Installation is now done by InstallAware, and there is no separate bootstrap utility; all is done within the new installer.

<H3>Multiple users on one machine</H3>
<p>The product can be installed by any licensed user with administrator privileges, 
  and is immediately available to all licensed users of the same machine. 
  It is also available to any licensed users you might add later.</p>
  
<h3>Installer might require a reboot</h3>
<p>You are prompted to reboot your system at the end of the installation 
  if the installer updated to Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1, or if the
  Microsoft .NET Framework v2.0 or MDAC 2.8 were installed from the installer setup. </p>
  
<h3>Installer requires additional temporary space</h3>
<p>If the drive containing the folder specified in your TEMP environment variable 
  is low on space, the Installer might halt with an error message noting the shortage. 
  If this occurs, you'll need to assign your TEMP variable to a folder on a drive 
  with more disk space, then rerun the installation. 
  See <A href="#requirements">Minimum System Requirements</A> for exact specification.</p>
  
<h3>Assemblies installed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC)</h3>
<p>Duplicate copies of assemblies installed in the GAC are provided in the 
&lt;CommonFilesFolder&gt;\CodeGear Shared\RAD Studio\Shared Assemblies\5.0 directory. If C:\ is your Windows drive, the 
  default &lt;CommonFilesFolder&gt; is C:\Program Files\Common Files\.</p>
  
<h3>Verifying Installation of Update 1 for Delphi 2007 for Win32</h3>
<p>To verify that your update has been installed, check the version number in the About box.  
The file timestamp is 11:00.</p>

<p>The only way to remove the update is to uninstall the product.</p>
<p>This update can be applied to all language editions.</p>


<h3>Additional information</h3>
<p>See the README.HTM file for additional information about the product.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="InstallingCB">Installing Either Product Using the Installation DVD (Delphi 2007 for Win32 (Update 1) or C++Builder 2007) </h2>
<strong>To install either product:</strong>
<ol><li>Insert the installation DVD; this should auto-run the installer.  If this does not happen, run Setup.exe from the install directory.</li>
<li>When prompted, enter the serial number (license key) for the product.</li>
<li>If you are prompted to select from Setup Personalities, select the product you are installing.</li>
</ol>

<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="InstallingBoth">Installing Both Delphi 2007 for Win32 (Update 1) and C++Builder 2007 Using the Installation DVD</h2>

<p>Use the appropriate procedure described below.</p>

<h3>To install both products on a system that does not contain either product:</h3>

<ol><li>Insert the installation DVD; this should auto-run the installer.  If this does not happen, run Setup.exe from the install directory.</li>
<li>When prompted, enter the serial number (license key) for the product you want to install.</li>

<li>After the install completes, initiate a secondary installation to install the second product:
<ul><li>Select <strong>Start menu | Programs | CodeGear RAD Studio | Modify, Repair, Uninstall</strong>. 
<li>In the maintenance dialog, choose <strong>Upgrade</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the serial number (license key) for the second product and complete the install.</li></li></ul>
</ol>

<h3>To install both products on a system that already contains Delphi 2007 for Win32:</h3>
<ol><li>Insert the installation DVD; this should auto-run the installer.  If this does not happen, run Setup.exe from the install directory.</li>
<li>When prompted, provide the appropriate serial number (license key) for C++Builder.</li>
<li>When prompted for personalities to install, select both C++Builder and Delphi 2007 for Win32.</li>
</ol>

  
<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Upgrading">Upgrading Delphi 2007 for Win32 Using the Installation DVD</h2>
If you have the original release of Delphi 2007 for Win32 on your system, you can upgrade to Update 1 
using the installation DVD.  (See later section about electronic delivery for alternate media.)
Setup.exe detects the earlier version of Delphi 2007 on your system and uninstalls 
that previous version and then install Delphi 2007 for Win32 Update 1.

<h3>To upgrade Delphi 2007 for Win32 to Update 1 on a system that already contains Delphi 2007 for Win32:</h3>
<ul><li>Using the installation DVD, run <strong>install\setup.exe</strong> with the <strong>/upgrade</strong> 
switch.  The /upgrade switch means that the installer displays fewer dialogs and installs the same edition of 
Delphi 2007 for Win32 that was previously on your system.
</li>
</ul>

<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="ElectronicInstall">Installing via Electronic Software Delivery</h2>
<p>If the product is purchased via Electronic Software Delivery, you receive a setup.exe file.  

<h3>To install using Electronic Software Delivery:</h3>
<ol><li>Double-click the setup.exe file to start the installation.</li>
<li>When prompted, enter your serial number (license key).</li>
<li>All the required ZIP files are downloaded from the Internet and uncompressed.</li>
<li><p>You are asked to supply an archive location for the install ZIP files.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Backing up the downloaded ZIP files is strongly
 encouraged so that in the future you can do a reinstall without downloading all the ZIP files again.</p>
 </li>
 <li>The install proceeds automatically.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To install the second product:</h3> 
 <p>If you have installed C++Builder 2007 or Delphi 2007 for Win32 Update 1, and you want to install the
 second product but you do not have an installation DVD, you can run a secondary or Maintenance install, 
 which is equivalent to running setup.exe from the DVD. Use the following steps:</p>  
 
 <ol><li>Select <strong>Start&gt;
 Programs | CodeGear RAD Studio | Modify, Repair, Uninstall</strong>. </li>
  
 <li>In the Maintenance dialog, choose to Upgrade your current installation.
</li>  
<li>Enter the new serial number (license key) for the second product.
</li></ol>
 
<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="ElectronicUpgrade">Upgrading Delphi 2007 for Win32 via Electronic Software Delivery</h2>
  
<p> If you have Delphi 2007 for Win32 and you want to upgrade to Delphi 2007 for Win32 Update 1:</p>
 
 <ol><li>
 Select <strong>Start | Programs | CodeGear RAD Studio | Check for updates</strong>.</li>
 <li>In the list of available updates, select Update 1.</li>
 <li>Your current Delphi 2007 for Win32 installation is uninstalled, 
 and then the required files are downloaded and installed automatically. 
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Due to the MSI registration and unregistration that take place, this upgrade
process might take an hour or two hours.  If you have problems with the download, 
you can restart the install by running <strong>setup.exe /upgrade</strong>, and the 
install attempts to start from where it ended.</p>

<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="NetworkLicense">Installing Using Purchased Network Licenses</h2>

If you purchased Networked Licenses (managed by the Borland License Server or FLEXlm) for Delphi 2007 for 
Win32 or C++Builder 2007, you must follow these instructions to set up the install image or your users 
will be prompted for a serial number and be unable to install. 
<ol><li>Copy all the files from your media kit DVD 
to a writeable directory on your network.</li>
<li>Copy the networked license .slip file you received in your 
order confirmation email to the \Install directory where setup.exe is located.</li>
<li>When your users run setup.exe, the product detects the .slip file and installs the software.  
During installation, the .slip file is moved to the license folder in the installation directory.</li></ol>

<p><A href="#top">Top</A> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="_Modifying_product_from">Modifying the Installed Product</h2>
<ul><li>After the product is installed, you can add optional products,
and/or add/remove features. Choose either method to modify the installed product:

<H2 id="Issues">Known Installation Issues</H2>

<ul>
  <li>If you modify the CodeGear product installation by clicking the <strong>Change</strong> 
    button in <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> and choosing the <strong>Modify</strong> 
    option to remove features, setup makes the appropriate 
    changes in the registry only in <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>. Follow any one of the 
    steps below to make these changes in <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</strong>. 
    <ul>
      <li> After doing a maintenance install from <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong>, 
        restart the IDE and click on <strong>No</strong> for all the <em>Package 
        not found</em> errors and <em>Assembly not found</em> errors. This automatically 
        removes the correct assembly or package entries from the registry and should 
        prevent these errors when starting CodeGear Delphi 2007. This is the preferred option, 
        since the options outlined below involve manually editing the registry.</li>
      <li> Manually edit the <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\BDS\5.0\Known IDE Packages</strong> 
	    and <strong>Known Packages</strong> 
        registry keys to delete the assemblies or packages that were removed by 
        the setup in <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Borland\BDS\5.0</strong>.</li>
      <li> Delete the <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\BDS\5.0</strong> registry key 
        and restart the IDE to get the updated registry settings. Be aware that 
        when you delete this key, you lose your customized settings that 
        were stored under this registry key. 
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Read the WARNING at the end of this file before 
          editing your system registry.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Uninstalling Delphi 2007 when an earlier version of BDS or C++Builder  
    is installed should not affect pre-existing installations.</p>
  </li>
<li>
You cannot have Delphi 2007 installed and install the C++ Trial version or vice versa.  
The personality associated with the trial will not have the files installed.
</li>
 
<li>
If you have a Delphi Trial installed and install C++Builder Enterprise or vice versa, 
your Delphi Trial will be uninstalled.
</li>
 
<li>
You cannot install the previous Delphi 2007 version over an installation of C++Builder 2007 or 
Delphi 2007 for Win32 (Update 1). If you want to reinstall Delphi on a system with C++Builder 2007, 
you must use the Delphi install from this DVD (Update 1).
</li>

<li id="RAID250266">
The Installer does not notify you if you have less than the required free space (2 GB on the C: drive).  
If you try to install with too little space, the install hangs.</li>

<H2 id="Uninstall">Uninstalling This Product</H2>

<ul><li>
<P>To uninstall the product, the Administrator who initially installed the product 
  must open the Control Panel, select <strong>Add or Remove Programs</strong>, 
  select <strong>RAD Studio</strong> and click the <strong>Remove</strong> 
  button. After uninstalling, in order to remove user-specific data from the Windows 
  registry, all non-Administrator users of the product must log in and delete 
  the following registry key:</P>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\BDS\5.0</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Registry editing is performed at your own risk. This 
  document and other documentation that accompanies this product describe how 
  to edit your Windows registry. In most cases, CodeGear recommends that you use 
  the Microsoft Regedit tool to perform editing. Whatever tool you use, however, 
  you should, before making any changes, make backups of your registry and thoroughly 
  familiarize yourself with the editing tool and the registry editing process. 
  The registry is a critical component of your operating system, and any mistakes 
  you make while editing it can cause your machine to stop functioning.</p>
</li>
 <li>After uninstalling, user-specific data such as default project settings might remain in 
 configuration files found in this directory:  
<p>Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application Data\Borland\BDS\5.0\</p>
<p>This folder should be manually removed.</p>
