   <h3>About:</h3>
     <blockquote>
      PasForum is a web forum powered by Pascal Web Unit/PSP 1.5.0. PasForum takes ideas from PSP4UM. Trustmaster (Vladimir) first wrote a forum called PSP4UM several years ago with older versions of PSP. PasForum is a rewritten and upgraded version by L505 (Lars) using the new PSP 1.5.X/Pascal Web Unit files. The sources for this PSP 1.5.X compatible forum are on SVN with the PSP/PWU project.
